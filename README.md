# ParkServe + City Park Facts Demo App
ParkServe + City Park Facts Demo App to demonstrate related table query using related table queries.

This particular example leverages [Esri Leaflet] (https://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/) and Esri Leaflet Related Records. Esri Leaflet Related Records is a small API helper to assist querying related tables published in ArcGIS Server or ArcGIS Online. It relies on the minimal Esri Leaflet Core which handles abstraction for requests and authentication when necessary. You can find out more about the Esri Leaflet Core [here](http://esri.github.com/esri-leaflet/downloads).
